# Echos of Depth(Death)

A game for the 2022 JS13K Game Jam. I could not promise that I would finish it, but fingers crossed.

## What is this game about ?

You are falling deep into an abyss. On the way there are obstacles to dodge and coins for you to collect. Your goal is to keep afloat as long as possible. One hit and you are out. Time afloat and collected coins count towards your score.

## How does it look like ?

You can go in 8 locations. Press <- and -> to go clock and counter-clockwise respectively. Press to dodge or to collect. Your choice

## Would you finish it ?

Depends on life giving me lemons or not.
